Introduction to TYPO3 Documentation
===================================

For an excellent introduction, please see the 3 part series on Marcus
Schwemer's blog TYPO3 Worx:

* `GUIDE TO TYPO3 DOCUMENTATION – PART 1: THE USER-INTERFACE <https://typo3worx.eu/2017/01/guide-to-typo3-documentation-part-1-the-ui/>`__
* `GUIDE TO TYPO3 DOCUMENTATION – PART 2: CONTENT STRUCTURE <https://typo3worx.eu/2017/01/guide-to-typo3-documentation-content-structure/>`__

.. important::

   Please note that the section "CONVERT REST TO “READABLE” FORMATS" in part 3 is
   slightly outdated. Currently, using the Docker container for :ref:`rendering
   <rendering-docs>` is the recommended approach. If you edit on GitHub directly,
   GitHub preview should be sufficient for making small changes.

.. _whats-typo3-documentation:

What's TYPO3 Documentation?
===========================

TYPO3 documentation may be one of the following:

* It can be one of the `official manuals <https://docs.typo3.org/>`__
  like :ref:`t3coreapi:start`.
* It can be the documentation of a
  `system extension <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SystemExtensions/Index.html>`__.
* It can be the documentation of a
  `third party extension <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/Index.html>`__.
* TYPO3 documentation can also be a
  `Changelog <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/latest/>`__
  entry for the core, for example a documented breaking change or new feature.

.. _common-characteristics-typo3-docs:

Common Characteristics of TYPO3 Documentation
=============================================

All of these examples have a few things in common:

* The documentation is rendered and found on https://docs.typo3.org
* The documentation has a **common theme**, all pages look similar and use the same styles
* Most of the documentation can be directly **edited by the community**. For third party
  extensions, this depends on where and how the source-code is hosted and maintained.
* The source of the documentation is written (mostly) in reStructuredText (**reST**)
* All documentation is rendered using the **same rendering toolchain**. All documentation
  can be rendered locally, with the officially supported Docker image.
* The documentation source files adhere to :ref:`general-conventions` and
  share a **common structure** (e.g. all documentation files in a
  :file:`Documentation` subdirectory).
* Due to the conventions, the rendering of documentation can be automated and
  every documentation project only requires a minimum of setup.

.. _whats-rendering:

What's "Rendering"?
===================

Rendering means (in this specific case) converting the reST
format (.rst files) into its final, readable form, which you can view in your
browser, like this page, which you are probably reading online. If not, load
https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/BasicPrinciples.html in your browser.

In comparison, this is what the original source file looks like:
https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/_sources/BasicPrinciples.txt

Technically, this means converting the reST (.rst files) into HTML, automatically
creating the menu, using the current theme to add additional styles and images.

.. _documentation-types:

Documentation Types
===================

Manual
------

A "manual" in the context of TYPO3 documentation is being used to talk about
one unit of documentation, which usually has it's own git repository (or is
included in the git repository of an extension) and consists of one :file:`Documentation`
folder. A "manual" can be a tutorial, such as the :ref:`t3start:start`, a guide,
an extension manual or something else.

.. _doc-type-tutorial:

Guide
-----

Guides are designed to be an **understanding-oriented** resource that provide an overview of a feature, tool or process. They familiarize the reader with a specific topic from a broad view or higher level. Guides are a good reference tool that a reader can refer to as needed, and can link out to more task-oriented resources such as Tutorials.

Tutorial
--------

A tutorial is a manual. 

Tutorials are designed to be a **learning-oriented** resource that take
newcomers by the hand and guide them through a specific topic. To facilitate effective
learning, tutorials provide examples to illustrate the subjects they cover.

They may not necessarily follow best-practices by the letter. They are
designed to make it easier to get started.

:ref:`Read more ... <writing-tutorial>`

The definitions for tutorials, guides, explanations and references were taken from
`Daniele Procida: What nobody tells you about documentation <https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/>`__

.. _doc-type-guide:

How-To Guide
------------

A guide is a manual.

Guides offer advice on **how best to achieve a given task**. They are goal oriented.

:ref:`Read more ... <writing-guide>`


.. _doc-type-reference:

Reference
---------

A reference is well structured and allows the reader to find information about a specific
topic. They should be short and to the point.


.. _doc-type-extension-manual:

Extension Manual
----------------

An extension manual covers only the extension. This documentation is (usually) included
in the source code of an extension in a :file:`Documentation` subdirectory.

.. _doc-type-official:

Official Documentation
----------------------

This documentation is authored and maintained by the TYPO3 community.

The Documentation Team generally maintains this documentation, but maintenance tasks
may be delegated to others, for example by giving write permission to GitHub repositories.

In general, it is recommended for the TYPO3 experts to take on jobs of continuously updating
content and making sure it is correct and up to date.

.. _doc-type-community:

Community Documentation
-----------------------

Third party extension manuals are typically "community documentation". 

This documentation is usually maintained by the extension author.

The TYPO3 Documentation Team cannot maintain "community documentation", but it
helps by providing documentation, support and an example extension manual.

Documentation Contribution Matrix
=================================


Considering how to contribute, the things that differ for various kinds of documentation
are:

* Where the issues are maintained (e.g. on Forge or GitHub)
* Where the source code (Git repository) is kept
* The workflow for making changes to the documentation

   :Workflow:     It depends, see :ref:`contribute-to-3rdparty-extension`



Official TYPO3 Manuals
----------------------

The official TYPO3 manuals are hosted on GitHub. Editing the documentation
requires a GitHub account and involves creating a pull request on GitHub.

Find out more about how to contribute: :ref:`docs-contribute`.

Documentation for the Core
--------------------------

The documentation for the core (changelog and system extensions) is added
to the TYPO3 source code. For this reason, the workflow of changing
something in the core documentation is very similar to adding a patch
to the core.

Find out more about the :ref:`core contribution workflow <t3contribute:Start>`
in general or about :ref:`t3contribute:Adding-documentation` in the Contribution
Guide.

In addition to using the core workflow, the core documentation can also
be changed via :ref:`"Edit on GitHub" <docs-contribute-github-method>`.
In this case, a Gerrit patch is created automatically from the pull request.

Documentation for 3rdparty Extensions
-------------------------------------

The documentation for a 3rdparty extension is maintained within the
source-code of this extensions. If and where it is edited depends
on where the extension is hosted and maintained.

If the extension is hosted on GitHub and correctly
:ref:`configured in Documentation/Settings.cfg <tip-edit-me-on-github>`,
extension documentation contributors
can also make changes via :ref:`"Edit on GitHub" <docs-contribute-github-method>`.

To find out how to contribute documentation for a specific extension:
:ref:`contribute-to-3rdparty-extension`

What about the Wiki?
--------------------

In this manual, we are focusing on TYPO3 documentation in reST / sphinx
that can be found on docs.typo3.org.

The TYPO3 Wiki on https://wiki.typo3.org does contain documentation as well,
but that is not the scope of this manual. In any case, most of the information
from the Wiki is being moved from the Wiki to some manual on docs.typo3.org.

.. _about-typo3-extensions:

About TYPO3 Extensions
======================

In TYPO3, basically everything is an extension. There are system extensions
and third party extensions:

System Extensions
-----------------

System extensions (or core extensions) are extensions that are maintained
in the TYPO3 source. For a list of system extensions, look in the Extension
Manager or in the TYPO3 source, e.g. `GitHub: TYPO3.CMS: /typo3/sysext
<https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/tree/master/typo3/sysext>`__.

Examples for system extensions are:

* `ext:form <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/form/>`__
* `ext:fluid_styled_content <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/fluid_styled_content/>`__
* `ext:rte_ckeditor <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/rte_ckeditor/>`__

Note, that if your system has been installed with Composer, not all system extensions may exist
in the system, if each system extension has been required separately as "subtree splitted packages"
(not as `typo3/cms`). Since TYPO3 9, installation of "subtree splitted packages" is mandatory.

For more information on subtree split, see

* `Usetypo3: The TYPO3 Subtree Split and Composer <https://usetypo3.com/typo3-subtree-split-and-composer.html>`__
* :ref:`Installation and Upgrade guide: Composer migration <composer-migration-require-subtree-packages>`

System Extension Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the documentation for a system extension on
`System extensions <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SystemExtensions/Index.html>`__.

Not all system extensions have documentation at the moment.

For more information about contributing to system extensions, see :ref:`contribute-to-system-extension`
in this guide.

See also :ref:`overview-of-types` for an overview of the issues, source and workflow for various
kinds of documentation, including system extensions.

Third Party Extensions
----------------------

Third party extensions are extension that can be created by anyone. They are not included in the TYPO3 core
codebase and are not officially supported by the TYPO3 core team.

Often, but not necessarily, these extensions are hosted on GitHub.

They can be installed by the TYPO3 Extension Manager or via Composer.

Third Party Extension Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the documentation on `Extensions by extension key <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/Index.html>`__.

For more information about contributing to third party extension documentation or for your own extension, see
:ref:`contribute-to-3rdparty-extension`. See :ref:`how-to-start-documentation-for-ext` for
information about starting extension documentation from scratch.

See also :ref:`overview-of-types` for an overview of the issues, source and workflow for various
kinds of documentation, including third party extensions.
